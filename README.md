# updated_website
this is the updated website....we have worked onn....
The modules We got can only do this amount of work

Note:
To run this programs you need to have apache tomcat or you can also run this program by renaming it as HTML and processing it on the live server
but HTML will not give you access for all of that stuffs.
so We have provided the jar files which you will have to integrate....then you will have to integerate the server then only you can access this files
We have also made some demo pages which were neccesary...It wil be changed as we will be started gettig the modules
The frontend team need to work on the animations, alerts,etc using javascript....We have only attached the amount of JS required for the backend
